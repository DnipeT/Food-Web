# Food-Web
This is a project that I made in my free time(my favorite:^). 
https://vfoodiee.netlify.app

In this React project, I have created a dynamic and user-friendly web application that makes the process of ordering food online easier with an eye-catching design and common sorting options. The primary objective of this project is to offer users an intuitive platform to browse a variety of food items, make selections, and place orders efficiently. I also have set up a connection between React and Airtable using NodeJS. I am using Render's free service. So, let me know if you guys wanna check my website out(Free instance types will spin down with inactivity.). My email is lenguyenerik@gmail.com
